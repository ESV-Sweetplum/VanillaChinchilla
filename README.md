The Ultimate Quaver plugin for mapping

> "The ultimate community-driven and open-source competitive SV plugin"

This is a plugin for [Quaver](https://github.com/Quaver), 
the ultimate community-driven and open-source competitive rhythm game.
The plugin provides various tools to place and edit notes in a variety of ways.

The plugin is still a work in progress, but here's what it can do so far:

### Edit Notes
- Adjust LN Lengths
- Shift Notes Left/Right
- Shift Notes Up/Down
- Flip Notes Vertically
- Switch Note Lanes

## Special Note
