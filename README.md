## Special Note
Many ideas for this plugin were inspired (stolen) from other plugins that were created by
[IceDynamix](https://github.com/IceDynamix) as well as
[Illuminati-CRAZ](https://github.com/Illuminati-CRAZ).

You can find many (but maybe not all) of those plugins created by them on GitHub or Quaver's Steam Workshop.
