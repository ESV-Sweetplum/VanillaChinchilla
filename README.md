> "The ultimate community-driven and open-source competitive mapping plugin"

This is a plugin for [Quaver](https://github.com/Quaver), the ultimate community-driven and open-source competitive rhythm game.
The plugin provides various tools to place and edit notes quickly and efficiently when making maps in the editor.

The plugin is still in Beta v1.0, so it's a work in progress and still undergoing development.
But, here's its features so far:

### Edit Notes (General)
- Shift Notes Up/Down
- Shift Notes Left/Right
- Switch Note Lanes
- Flip Notes Vertically
- (COMING SOON) Scale Note Spacing
- (COMING SOON) Shear Note Positions

### Edit Notes (LNs)
- (COMING SOON) Extend LNs
- Inverse LNs
- Adjust LN Lengths
- Change LNs to Rice

## Special Note
Many ideas for this plugin were inspired (stolen) from other plugins that were created by
[IceDynamix](https://github.com/IceDynamix) as well as
[Illuminati-CRAZ](https://github.com/Illuminati-CRAZ).

You can find many (but maybe not all) of those plugins created by them on GitHub or Quaver's Steam Workshop.
